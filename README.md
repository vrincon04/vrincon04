<h2 align='center'><samp><strong>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Victor RincÃ³n</strong></samp></h2>

I'm a developer who currently works with PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter, Magento), JavaScript (JQuery, Angular), and SQL (MySQL, MSSQL). I have an obsession with learning, whether itâ€™s to sharpen my existing skills or to explore new ones such as Python (Django), React, Firebase, MongoDB, etc. I also enjoy running, hiking, biking, cooking, play video games, series, movie, and TaeKwonDo.
